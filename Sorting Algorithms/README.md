# Sorting Algorithms 
Given an array of n elements, sort them according to a comparison operator on the elements.
## Selection Sort
### File name: selection-sort.py
In this algorithm, you sort the array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (in ascending order) from the unsorted part of the array and put it at the beginning. This algorithm has same performance irregardless of the nature of the input, having time complexity of O(n^2).
